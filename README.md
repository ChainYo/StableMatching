# StableMatching

---

This project is a filler for downtime during our AI studying.  

We grouped with 5 members of people interested to enhance their code skills and AI learning.  

We are starting this to resolve a problem the formation administration met during students and enterprises matching.

This is our solution, in an open project.  
Feel free to contribute.

## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to create a web application for a stable matching algorithm. We want you to be able to use the algorithm with `n` students/enterprises and with AI enhencements. 

For a better understanding of `stable matching algorithm`, please refer to our stable matching explanations [here](./stable_marriage_problem.md).
